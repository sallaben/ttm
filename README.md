TagPro Time Manager

Install userscript with the Tampermonkey extension.

During the time spent in the TagPro joiner ("game loader") screen, you will have the opportunity to set a time limit on your entertainment. 

**ttm** will automatically kick you out of the TagPro joiner once you have exceeded the amount of time you allot for yourself. It will not kick you out of a game if you run out of time while ingame - the userscript will wait until that game finishes to send you to the login screen.
