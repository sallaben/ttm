# ttm
## TagPro Time Manager

Install this userscript with the Tampermonkey extension. [Read me if you don't know how to do this.](https://tampermonkey.net/faq.php#Q102)

During the time spent in the TagPro joiner ("game loader") screen, you will have the opportunity to set a time limit on your entertainment. 

**ttm** will remove you from the TagPro game joiner once you have exceeded the amount of time you specify. It will not kick you out of a game if you run out of time - the userscript will wait until your game finishes.
